Here is a list of a must-watch stuff I'll be hosting here regardless of torrents

- My Little Pony
- Jojo
- Monogatari
- Adventure Time
- Steven Universe
- Daria (just because)
- Rick and Morty
- Breaking Bad

(following possibly, they can be usually found on other hostings, but still)
- Family Guy

(not including classic like Scrubs here, since they are not harassed by copyrighters much, though I may be wrong)


Music

- Confusion will be my requiem
