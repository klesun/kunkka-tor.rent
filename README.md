A web app that allows playing video/music from torrents directly in the browser, without downloading to PC

Unlike projects like https://webtor.io/, this one will get advantage of it nonameness and will be more positioned towards giving users access to the torrents rather than just provide an engine to play a torrent file from your pc. Also I think webtor.io streams through server and applies priced rate limits, which won't be happening here as you will be peering the torrent yourself in your browser, without a middleman service, the site will only host the client scripts and tools that will help you find torrent files in the database from various trackers.

Most likely will be powered by https://webtorrent.io/intro
