A web app that allows playing video/music from torrents directly in the browser, without downloading to PC

Unlike projects like https://webtor.io/, this one will get advantage of it nonameness and will be more positioned towards giving users access to the torrents rather than just provide an engine to play a torrent file from your pc. Also I think webtor.io streams through server and applies priced rate limits, which won't be happening here as you will be peering the torrent yourself in your browser, without a middleman.

Most likely will be powered by https://webtorrent.io/intro
